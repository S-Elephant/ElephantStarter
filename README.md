# Add more shortcuts

You can add more shortcuts by adding them to the "\<installation folder\>\Shortcuts\\" folder. You can also open this folder by starting the application, right click its system tray icon and click "Toggle menu". Then click on the play folder icon near the top left of the newly opened menu.

You can also create directories and put them into there instead. You cannot nest directories. Nested directories would prevent you from quickly being able to access them and thus beat the point of this application.

# Start when Windows starts

Start the program, right click its system tray icon and click "Toggle menu". Then click on the play button icon near the top left of the newly opened menu.
